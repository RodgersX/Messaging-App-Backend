This is a Nodejs + Express project that I'm building progressively

# Have nodejs installed globally
 visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to get nodejs installed on your OS

# Open project with any text editor
I prefer VS Code

# Run 'npm i' to install all dependencies and packages

# Run 'npm run start' to fire up your localhost
